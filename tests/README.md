Tests are divided into two folders:

    unit/
    functional/

Unit tests are tests that NOT use the Facebook webdriver or headless browser. Functional tests are tests that do.

Functional tests are divided into back-end (survey administration) and front-end (survey taking) tests.

Unit tests are divided into models, helpers, controllers, etc.
